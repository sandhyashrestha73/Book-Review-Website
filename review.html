            <p  >Published in 1960, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is more than a novel; it is a 
                foundational text of American literature. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and has sold over 50 million copies
                 worldwide, becoming a staple of school curricula and a touchstone for discussions about racial injustice, moral
                  integrity, and the loss of innocence.Harper Lee's masterpiece remains as relevant today as when it was first published. 
                The character development of Scout Finch and the moral courage of Atticus Finch create a compelling narrative
                 that explores complex themes of racism, justice, and childhood innocence.Set in the small, sleepy town of Maycomb, Alabama,
                  during the Great Depression, the story is narrated by Jean Louise "Scout" Finch, looking back on her childhood. The plot unfolds 
                  over three years, centering on Scout, her older brother Jem, and their friend Dill, and their fascination with the mysterious and reclusive neighbor, Arthur "Boo" Radley.
                Their childhood games and superstitions are juxtaposed with the weightier adult world when their widowed father, Atticus Finch, a
                 lawyer of profound integrity, is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. 
                 The trial exposes the deep-seated racial prejudice of the town and forces Scout and Jem to confront the complexities of human nature—the
                  coexistence of good and evil, justice and injustice, courage and cowardice.</p>

            <h3 >Full Review</h3>
            <p >Parijat's "Shirish Ko Phool" (1965) is not just a novel; it is a cultural and literary monument in Nepal.
                 Winning the prestigious Madan Puraskar in its year of publication, the book shattered conventions and continues to resonate deeply 
                 with readers for its raw, unflinching portrayal of a generation adrift, grappling with the aftermath of a failed political revolution and the perennial questions
                  of life, love, and death.Parijat's most famous work is a poignant story that delves
                 into the complexities of human relationships and emotional turmoil. The novel's lyrical quality and deep 
                 emotional resonance have made it a beloved classic in Nepali literature.The story is narrated by Suyogbir, a cynical and disillusioned ex-revolutionary who lives a 
                 life of quiet despair in a rented room in Kathmandu. His monotonous existence is disrupted by the arrival of Sakambari, a fiercely independent, terminally ill, and 
                 emotionally turbulent young woman. Suyogbir, along with his friend Brishabah, becomes entangled in Brisha's life. The novel unfolds as a complex love triangle, but it 
                 is ultimately a profound exploration of Brisha's quest for meaning, love, and a dignified death amidst her
                  physical and emotional pain. The "Shirish flower" of the title becomes a powerful symbol of fragile beauty and inevitable decay, mirroring Brisha's own life.</p>
